In
1925
Stalin
came
into
power
afterthe
death
of
Vladmir
Lenin 
He
based
his
policies
around
his
idea
of
Socialism
in
One
Country
which
would
rapidly
industrialise
Russia
in
order
to
catch
up
with
Western
Countries
such
as
Britain 
However
these
goals
lead
to
not
only
a
massive
change
in
the
Russian
economy
and
industry
but
also
on
Russian
Society 
His
ideas
of
Collectivisation
and
Industrialisation
were
revolutionary
however
these
ideas
brought
along
with
them
slave
labour the
purges
and
the
Show
trials
Stalin
realised
how
backwards
Russia
was
when
it
came
to
its
economy
and
he
wanted
to
turn
it
into
a
modern
industrialised
country 
He
used
3
five
year
plans
to
achieve
a
fully
industrialised
Russia
by
1941 
The
first
Five
year
plan
happened
from
1928-1932 
Its
main
focus
was
heavy
industry
and
set
unrealistic
goals
like
300%
increase
in
coal
and
iron
supply
and
200%
in
consumer
goods 
Towns
developed
around
new
factories
such
as
the
steel
works
in
Magnitogorsk
or
Oil
refineries
in
Causasus 
Many
workers
were
provided
from
Gulags
for
slave
labour 
This
new
sizeable
workforce
led
to
poor
living
conditions
which
in
turn
led
to
a
high
death
rate 
The
focus
on
heavy
industry
meant
that
there
was
often
shortages
of
other
essentials
such
as
food
and
this
lead
to
mass
starvation
across
the
workforce
and
Russia
The
2nd
Five
year
plan
from
1933-1938
continued
to
focus
on
developing
heavy
industry
within
the
Soviet
Union
but
also
a
new
focus
was
put
on
the
development
of
transport
and
other
public
schemes 
The
Railway
was
extended
and
the
Moscow
Underground
was
built 
The
Moscow/Volga
Canal
was
also
constructed
with
22 000
workers
dying
during
construction 
The
3rd
Five
year
plan
from
1938-1941
concentrated
on
the
armament
of
Russian
troops
and
Russia’s
military
might
due
to
the
escalating
tensions
between
Germany
and
other
European
countries 
This
plan
was
cut
short
due
to
the
german
invasion
of
Russia 
By
the
1940’s
Stalin
had
achieved
in
turning
Russia
into
an
industrialised
nation
However
the
problem
with
industrialisation
was
that
Russia
had
a
lack
of
funds
to
build
the
factories
and
schemes 
Stalin
planned
to
use
collectivisation
to
raise
money
to
be
spent
on
industry 
The
idea
of
collectivisation
was
to
amalgamate
small
farms
into
much
larger
farms 
Its
aim
was
to
produce
surplus
food
to
feed
the
expanding
cities
population
and
to
export
food
to
fund
industrialisation 
It
also
aimed
to
introduce
Machinery
to
improve
efficiency
and
free
up
workers
for
industrialisation 
It
was
to
be
voluntary
however
the
peasants
disliked
the
yield
and
profit
from
trial
farms
causing
grain
delivery
to
fall
Stalin
became
furious
with
the
peasant
denial
and
so
turned
it
into
a
mandatory
operation 
Enforced
by
the
NKVD 
farms
were
forcefully
amalgamated
but
the
peasants
especially
Kulaks
resisted 
Those
caught
resisting
were
arrested
and
sent
to
the
Gulags
and
used
as
slave
labour
to
build
factories 
Poor
peasants
were
encouraged
to
turn
in
the
Kulaks
and
this
class
in
society
was
eventually
eliminated 
Resistance
continued
so
Stalin
decided
to
use
Ukraine
as
an
example
by
using
man
made
famine 
Its
grain
quota
was
raised
by
44%
which
led
to
widespread
famine
as
the
workers
could
no
longer
feed
themselves 
This
broke
the
resistance
and
after
2-3
years
of
bad
yields
agricultural
production
increased
By
the
mid
1930’s
Stalins
paranoia
grew
about
enemies
within
the
state 
In
1935
the
assassination
of
Sergei
Kirov
led
to
what
was
called
the
Purges 
This
was
the
purge
of
any
enemies
of
the
Soviet
Union
who
plotted
against
in
it
in
some
way
and
gave
stalin
the
ability
to
blame
his
policies
failures
on
his
enemies 
Millions
of
innocent
Russians
were
either
executed
or
sent
to
Gulags
which
resided
in
the
most
inhabital
parts
of
the
Soviet
Union
usually
Siberia 
During
the
purges
no
one
was
safe
from
Stalins
wrath
as
was
seen
by
the
arrests
of
some
of
the
old
Bolsheviks
like
Kamenev
who
were
put
on
trial 
The
first
of
these
Show
Trials
were
held
in
1936
and
old
Bolsheviks
such
as
Kamenev
and
Zinoviev
were
put
on
trial
for
charges
of
plotting
to
kill
lenin
and
stalin 
to
breakdown
the
Soviet
Union
and
return
Democracy
to
Russia 
Being
judged
by
Andrei
Vyshinsky
who
was
stalins
puppet
and
forced
confessions
from
the
NKVD
their
pre-decided
verdicts
of
guilty
were
handed
down
to
all
16
men
on
trial
and
they
were
all
executed
along
with
some
family
members
also
being
killed 
Not
one
pleaded
innocent
due
to
the
torture
done
to
them
by
the
NKVD
The
Second
Show
Trial
took
place
in
1937 
17
defendants
in
total
were
trialed
for
working
with
Trotsky
and
plotting
to
kill
stalin 
The
men
such
as
Karl
Radek
were
old
supporters
so
were
easily
blamed
while
also
many
figures
from
industrialisation
were
also
used
as
so
to
blame
its
failures
on
them 
Like
before 
their
forced
confessions
and
pre-decided
verdicts
of
guilty
meant
that
13
were
executed
while
4
were
sent
to
the
Gulag
The
Third
Show
Trial
took
place
in
1938
with
21
men
being
trialed
for
smilar
crimes
as
the
men
before
them 
Among
these
were
editor
of
the
Bravada
Nicholas
Bukharin
and
Nikolai
Krestinsky
who
at
first
amazingly
pleaded
not
guilty 
Again
all
21
men
were
shot
and
this
ended
The
Show
Trials
which
had
shocked
countries
across
the
world
In
1937
a
purge
of
the
Red
Army
also
took
place
due
Stalin
fearing
a
possible
military
takeover 
Many
leaders
of
the
army
were
arrested
and
trialed
just
as
the
Bolsheviks
had
been
with
them
being
either
executed
or
sent
to
the
Gulags 
In
all
around
50%
or
35000
officers
were
killed
which
severely
damaged
the
Armies
leadership 
Along
with
the
Army
a
purge
of
foreign
nationals
took
place
with
over
10000
polish
communists
being
killed 
The
purges
finally
ended
in
1938
with
Stalin
happy
with
what
it
had
achieved
and
completely
backing
up
his
actions
as
necessary
for
the
Soviet
Union 
However
throughout
all
this
turmoil
and
the
massacre
of
his
own
people
Stalin
used
propaganda
to
promote
how
well
his
policies
of
industrialisation
and
collectivisation
had
worked
and
blamed
any
failures
on
the
men
that
had
been
executed
during
the
show
trials 
He
created
a
cult
of
personality
for
himself
which
made
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
Soviet
people
as
a
Superman
or
God-like
figure
who
could
do
no
wrong
while
other
countries
look
at
Stalin
with
suspicion
and
contempt 
Cities
were
renamed
after
him
such
as
Stalingrad
which
was
vital
in
the
war
and
Stalinbad 
He
was
given
nicknames
such
as
‘Father
of
Nations’
and
Soviet
History
was
rewritten
to
give
him
a
more
central
role
in
the
October
Revolution 
The
impact
Stalin
had
on
the
economic
and
social
aspects
of
the
Soviet
Union 
Although
Industrialisation
and
Collectivisation
had
achieved
their
economic
goals
and
turned
Russia
into
a
modern
efficient
industrialised
country
however
the
means
Stalin
used
to
achieve
his
goals
was
truly
shocking
and
horrific 
Around
7
million
people
died
in
the
man
made
famine
in
Ukraine
and
its
estimated
another
3
million
died
due
to
poor
living
conditions
and
slave
labour 
In
1939
a
revised
census
tried
to
hide
the
loss
in
population
but
around
10%
of
the
USSR’s
population
was
missing
which
added
up
to
around
15
million
people
showing
the
mass
of
victims
due
to
the
Purges
This
mass
devastation
of
the
countrys
population
and
its
secretive
ways
made
other
European
powers
mistrust
it
and
this
forced
him
into
an
alliance
with
hitler
which
gave
him
a
false
sense
of
security
as
USSR
was
invaded
by
Germany
in
1941 
The
real
death
toll
of
Stalins
reign
is
unknown
but
some
historians
estimate
in
to
be
around
30
million 
One
historian
stated
that
 No
one
in
history
has
ever
raged
such
a
war
on
his
people  
This
shows
that
no
matter
how
successful
Stalins
achievement
to
the
economy
the
terrible
impact
on
society
and
 human
cost
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
gain
in
economic
efficiency
